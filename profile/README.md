# nearByEVCharging

NearByEV-Charging! Your GitHub sponsorship goes directly to our Open Collective fund. Our goal is to secure funding for core team members around the world to help EV-Charging (Open Charge Point Protocol) ship more frequent and more innovative releases.

We're a team of distributed volunteers around the world working on all aspects of EV-Chargingâ€” The core project, documentation, icons, and more. Keeping up-to-date with bug reports, feature requests, and more is time-consuming and often difficult. We'd like to continue to support and incentivize our core team, while also allowing us to expand into recruiting new full-time maintainers.
